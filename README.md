!Paper details wil adding later. 

This is my first paper during working as research intern at NAIST for about 3 months.

How to run my code
1. Create .env file which store your OPENAI_API_KEY which allows you to access the ChatGPT.
2. Create your own PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY and put in the score.py file.
3. Then i think it would works now.
