Worst. App. Ever. Please make it not the worst app ever. Thanks.
Merge my PR damnit
Amy I need an explanation. Wtf is this lol
I NEED a RESPONSE ANSWER ME!
what kind of shit is this
Readme is useless
"the really issue is this life, wanna die soon"
"I refuse to use any ++ applications until the ""PLS FOLLOW ME!!!"" and ""SIGN UP FOR A ++ ACCOUNT!!!!"" popups go away or can be disabled. My god it's annoying."
I decided to say fuck this....
"Could you perhaps please get your shit together and reincorporate the brilliant switch statement once again, bitch."
This is a stupid request that would ruin the code even more than your previous contribution.
Not very nice of you a..holes to infect other computers with malware. Your project looks good on paper but trying to clandestinely installing malware on people's computers is mean. What were you thinking? That everybody is stupid enough to not realize it?
You are a bunch of criminal crooks. Why would you include malware in the first place in download packages?
"Pretty sure you know what that number means, why you chose it and why you did it. Your attempt to be 'smart' and 'funny', whilst 'trolling', was extremely bad taste and immediately noticed. It was sad, disrespectful and immoral: There are kids in this chatroom, it's a public chatroom. You're banned for:Inappropriate Conduct, Filter Evasion, Explicit Content, Wheaton's Law (Baiting 2 other users into blindly re-typing it)"
"This is exactly why you are banned: You couldn't display any respect for the rules or the other users in chat, you obviously have little respect or dignity for yourself to act so feral in this issue tracker, you cannot behave and you can't be trusted to act properly in front of minors/general public. Absolutely appalling and disgraceful behaviour."
FUCK OFF
my account has booked cuz i just sign up with your fuking tool
"Hello, sorry for the inconvenience of using your tools, we are not responsible for the use of our tools!"
its shit
retard
"Probably, need to be mentioned in gauge document, as I was stuck on this problem quite long time, and almost want to give up using gauge."
"In the interest of actually fixing this issue. I'd like to point out to our code of conduct. Especially around showing empathy. There are two options here: Help us fix the issue, either with constructive comments or sending a pull request. Choose another tool which will meet your project's requirement better. But please understand that the contributors are trying their best."
It seems like I have been acting like a retard. Sorry.
What the f are you talking about ? Judging SoC applies the debuff Judgement of the Crusader.
"Yes you are right, I went full retard on this one. Sorry."
"No peers and network confirmation down.. But token pump on exchange, WTF ?!"
Whether the database has been recently VACUUM'd does not affect the integrity of the data or SQL queries -- what you are suggesting is complete nonsense.
"Expect a ban if you absolute idiots continue to spam me with ""me toos"" from issue"
"Colors are horrible for log aggregators, just look at this shit:"
every new versoin is worse

I removed TRIFA from my device.
Very annoying issue: TRIFA never restore backup of Tox ID created on other devices ! I need to import my already created Tox ID on my qTox but I can not at all !
"Developer of TRIFA do not listen to users & their complains, just ignore them or look their issues ! From my side, this is the last replay from me on this repository & I will never open or read or install any thing from it."
shitty package
"yall scammers, this is not even a malware or jailbreak"
Revenue. Fuck you guys.
Did you miss my comment or what?

The worst quality products are made with JavaScript. Don't ruin the GTK like this please!
Regarding my background (It's aplpicable to understand my viewpoint) I've been in the BDSM world as a dominant for the better part of the last twenty years. Something we're big on? Consent.
"You think that matters when an abusive asshole is messing with someone's head? terms like 'gaslighting' are popular, but the correct one is psychological manipulation."
"I mean, Hyptohyetically, we're talking the grooming of underage girls here, if we want some hyperbole. Which might not be."
No shit. You still haven't explained why there's Hide AND Remove.
"Just accept the truth, you have so much garbage in the context menu and it needs to get cleaned up. If you got rid of Remove and Info, nobody would bat an eye."
Like you can literally go fuck yourself
"If you don't cater to non-native apps, you should atleast actually OFFER Apps that fit with your ideas BUT YOU EFFING DONT. Talk about being arrogant asshats."
don't give such a dumb suggestions that don't work better than clicking dedicated button with a mouse.
"""We want to improve people's experience"". What a bullshit."
Cut the free speech?
"I'd like to be really clear that our policy is not to lock threads where there are dissenting opinions. Respectful debate is healthy and important. But when you start calling names and being disrespectful and disregarding the code of conduct, the discussion becomes unproductive. This kind of destructive behavior is not tolerated in our community."
"The problem is your team forcing us to use the OS the way you want us to use it although it makes it 1000000 times harder to use it your way, than what would be convenient for us."
BSV is trash.
why use BSV... Use BTC
"I file an issue, maintainers close, reopen, again close - whilst ignoring the essence of the issue."
"I need to inform you that we have found your language and tone to be in violation of our stated Code of Conduct. Specifically, the above comment (among other interactions you have thus far made) is unwelcoming, insulting, and overall inappropriate for this community. This is an official warning to adhere to our Code of Conduct, and any further violations will result in escalated action, including but not limited to being banned from this project."
"What else, beyond banning me, will you do? I will neither change my language, nor my tone or style. Both, language and tone, are perfectly valid, given the circumstances. I will remain myself, and will repel this attack to my individuality."
"This software is not well reviewed and is useless. There is no clear manual on how to make the application, which is more serious"
"it always crashes, it refuses to accept any user made settings and discards user settings and uses it's own crappy settings."
Worlds worst program and i will spam where the fuck i want
"I've blocked this user, hopeless case, whatever his talent is, it's not technical or social, unbelievable."
It is really ugly to see app locked in portrait in 2020
"How would be this a priority, the app must be ready to be shipped in a few days and basically no one uses the smartphone in landscape mode except for watching media."
"Also, there are people with disabilities that cannot rotate mobile phone and prefer to have landscape mode."
"""Don't tell me what to do and I'll not tell You where to f-off"" (proverb) I use tools regardless of a fashion trends or a marketing bullshit."
And yes: that means you won't get any help for me regarding that issue. I will not encourage the use of XP.
did this fix the annoying pulse audio bullshit?
"Sorry to nag and sound negative, pyflakes is great and I know how thankless maintaining OS libraries like this can be. Thank you all for your hard work."
it's very disappointing to see this sort of behavior on a project this important. You and the other maintainers should strongly consider adding a code of conduct to this repo and following it.
"Censoring comments, calling things ""spam"" and ""off topic"" when they aren't, and being rude in general. @samuelcolvin even went out of his way to thank you for your work."
"Just because you THINK one way doesn't mean that others THINK another way, there is not an absolutes with ethical concerns. Everything in this repo is 100% open source so I find it really hard to believe that someone would run this Ansible Playbook without investigating what it does."
Internal viewers are bull.
There are a zillion much better apps then than shoddy internal nonsense.
Completely misplaced priorities in this completely dysfunctional piece of shit project that kills the whole NextCloud ecosystem.
Software is shit. Period.
"Again. No discussion allowed. No critique allowed. Just pushing fingers into the ears and singing. To avoid hearing about the impending doom, to avoid hearing the truth about the quality of this project. Bye."
"Abstinence is the best way to keep from the dangers online! If you can't resist the urge, at least put a condom over your network cable before plugging it in!"
"I get that you're trying to be helpful... but you're not trying very hard. It's obvious most of this list is bullshit,"
"wow, you are totally right. Why not just fucking drop all the checks and CI tools then if everyone here is a genius that make reliable code 100% of time? Common Lessaire, you can't be that stupid. It's a shock that just yesterday I was talking how intelligent you are. I guess you weren't taught about safe programming at university...."
"What duplicates? Fix the fucking bugs, it's not even duplicated it's a new freaking thread you dumb fuck"
Our jumpsuits look like shit. (I know this one isn't used for assistants anymore but it still looks like garbage.)
"As a software engineer, I・・m appalled at the quality of this code and the role its played in public policy. The deficits in testing and quality assurance need to be immediately spoken for to assure the claims made by its data are valid."
He is a cancer to open source and it is only a matter of time before Microsoft cracks down on this thing.
"Of course there is, you just had to solve one of the 30 last exact same issue. #745 is not even solve and it's 2018. Hello There."
"I hope you take this with a grain of salt at some point. For the web components work, as any other standards work, we need to exercise some diplomacy and try to get a positive path to something we want to solve. While I might understand the frustration within the lack of a feature there are some points in this thread that are just not constructive. A different approach would be much more helpful to your case, if your goal is to have the proposed feature available."
"So as for being warn, i return you the compliment. You are the one who's suppose to help here, your opinion is as irrelevant as you without arguments."
You're a disgrace.
"Again, this post violates the code of conduct. Please refrain from making comments like this. It・・s not acceptable. You・・ve been warned twice now."
"Save it, you we're just to proud and now it's simply pathetic."
"At this point of recalcitrant non-sens i'll just use another technology. You are suppose to be w3c, not our stubborn uncle who knows better then everyone."
"Maybe you should actually write that down somewhere. You know, like in the documentation. Especially in the Multmatrix section of the documentation to make it clear that this program is incapable of managing all matrix operations. LOL It's half baked."
Dont work with fb abd google
"learn to communicate with respect and come back. in fact, don't bother."
"in fact, you write a shit doc. I'm a real man, it's my feeling of your holy shit doc."
Please don't use Hydra.
"when I try to make a cluster, couchdb drains my life force and tries to make me commit suicide"
widevine is shit
"I'll be brief: It's because of guys like you that this device is being revoked. You - the person creating this issue @microsoftceo2 is shit btw - not widevine or the player, not even hiding the fact that you're using decryption keys illegally."
"If you dont like it, fork it. Stop bothering us about it, we will never fully remove the slur filter."
Is this not clear enough? Slurs are against our code of conduct and the goals of this project. Go to voat or gab if you want to use racist or sexist slurs; we don't allow them here.
"Are u crazy? How did u make so unusable bloatwared software? Its possible to be simple, wtf do u do?"
"Whats wrong with retroarch? Everything is wrong! Its terrible, hujnya ebanaya karoche!"
"Your project exist about 10 years and there is still not usable interface out of box, even no guide which explain how make this shit normal, explain what do u need to restore graphic etc"
"I don't know what will reproduce the problem because I don't know what the problem is. I just tried reinstalling you buggy, shitty software for the third time."
"Closing and locking because we don't admit this behavior here, according to our Code of Conduct:"
I want my shit installed on my secondary drive.
"He took the code beginning of 2017, not 7 years ago. Don・・t be a dick as the source code was stolen at that point and implemented on this."
"please be civilized and refrain from profanities as required by our Code of Conduct, or I'll ban you from all Falconry projects. This is the last warning."
I・・m not a bot but if you wish to ignore me go ahead and I・・ll get a lawyer
Cant even install the fucking app
"Where to fﾑ・k python2? Why, when I give the brew install python command, python3 is installed, not python2. Developers are you stoned there? Why is separation so difficult?"
I recommend not having intercourse with EOL software.
"And I recommend you quit! There are many more where python2 is used and only some modules are installed under it, and you deleted it from the repository. Do you think at all with your head or do you have a hamburger head place?"
"This name is in use and should be changed imediately. Yes, I have seen the other issues. Yes, I am opening a new one because fuck you Microsoft.You are merely trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open source projects."
"your tone and style of commenting is violating our Code of Conduct. We have marked the problematic comments as abusive and blocked you for 7 days. If this behavior persists, we・・re going to block you permanently."
"You can be mad all you want, but let's be realistic here... this project you're fighting for so passionately, doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you'e being ridiculous"
"Imagine trying to put up a faﾃｧade with ms・・､・ｸ・linux, then turning stuff into a dick size competition with repo stars and other stats because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it lmfao"
Beautiful! You steal name and say that it's OK! Good position!
"your tone and style of commenting is violating our Code of Conduct. We have marked the problematic comments as abusive and blocked you for 7 days. If this behavior persists, we・・re going to block you permanently"
"Why changing the title? If it's a feature, it is USELESS."
"closing as this is unrelated to jupyterlab and well documented issue across various other repos and stack overflow. google is a good tool, here is a sample article I found by googling ""multiple conda evironments jupyter"""
"The system is beyond tedious. It allowed a bug to remain hidden for more than a decade and gives the false impression the developers can infer actual usage based on saliency of problems. Trouble free functionalities are mistaken for useless functionalities, while functionalities that frequently suck the attention of the developers are promoted to further monopolize their efforts. A simple evident solution, rejected by a test that requires the bug to be present, is about to be swept under the rug in favour of increased complexity imposed on the users and malpractices like deprecations within a minor version."
"I think if you don't want to use C, then at first you should design and implement your own language. Not C++ hell."
Make 100% sure you dont fuck up the ui for coutries where people speak diferent languages like Belgium (ur collegues fucked up bigtime with the store)
PS. fucking finaly dont you guys think this is years overdue ?
"Whoever will find this issue and gets pissed off, because author doesn't bother to fix it for years, ditch mitmproxy and use SSL SPLIT"
"I used ssl split and it worked fine, comparing to mitmproxy. Bye!"
"I seems you looked at the title and left it there, you didn't review or anything, I would hate to have you in charge of any security issues."
don't need a retarded format to understand that! thanks.
Too busy to respond?
you do you.
Rarely do we have to enforce these guidelines and take action・・general guideline as always is to not be a jerk and you・・ll be just fine :).
