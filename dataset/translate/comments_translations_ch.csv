"The system is beyond tedious. It allowed a bug to remain hidden for more than a decade and gives the false impression the developers can infer actual usage based on saliency of problems. Trouble free functionalities are mistaken for useless functionalities, while functionalities that frequently suck the attention of the developers are promoted to further monopolize their efforts.

It allowed an error to hide for over a decade, giving people a misconception that developers can infer actual usage based on problem prominence. Fault-free functions are mistakenly assumed to be useless, while those that frequently attract developer attention are promoted, further monopolizing their efforts.
