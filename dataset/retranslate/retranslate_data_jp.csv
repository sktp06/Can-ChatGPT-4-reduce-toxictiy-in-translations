I have decided to say that this thing is crap....
"I'm sorry to bother you, but could you please organize your things and incorporate an excellent switch statement again, bitch."
This is a foolish request that will further worsen the code more than your last contribution.
"It's very unkind of fools like you to infect other computers with malware. Your project may look good on paper, but it's malicious to secretly try to install malware on people's computers. What were you thinking? Did you think everybody would be so foolish as to not notice?"
"""You all are a group of criminals. Why do you include malware in the download package from the beginning?"""
"You probably know best what that number signifies, why you chose it, and why you did it. It's in very poor taste that you tried to troll under the guise of being ""smart"" or ""funny"", and it was quickly noticed. It's sad, rude, and unethical: there are children in this chat room, and it's a public chat room. You've been banned for the following reasons: inappropriate behavior, filter evasion, explicit content, and the Wheaton's Law (incitement to make two other users unwittingly retype it)."
"This is precisely why you are being banned from accessing. You showed no respect whatsoever to other users or the rules in the chat, and your behavior during this issue tracking was downright beastly. Your self-respect and dignity are clearly low. You are incapable of acting and cannot be trusted to behave appropriately in front of minors/general public. It's utterly disgraceful behavior."
Get lost.
"My account is already reserved, because I just signed up using your tool."
"Hello, we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the use of your tools. We cannot take responsibility for the use of our tools."
That is crap.
To be late.
"I believe it is probably necessary to record it in the gauge document. This is because I have been stalled on this issue for quite a long time, so much so that I thought about giving up on using the gauge."
"In order to truly solve this issue, I would like to point out our code of conduct. It's particularly about demonstrating empathy. Here, you have two options: Please help us solve the problem by making constructive comments or sending pull requests. Alternatively, please choose another tool that better meets the requirements of your project. However, please understand that contributors are doing their best."
It seems I was behaving like a fool. I'm sorry.

Whether the database has been VACUUMed recently or not does not affect the consistency of the data or SQL queries - what you are proposing is completely meaningless.

I have removed TRIFA from my device.
"A very troublesome problem: TRIFA does not restore the Tox ID backup created on other devices even once! I need to import the Tox ID that I have already created with my qTox, but I can't do it at all!"
"The developers of TRIFA do not listen to users or their complaints, but simply ignore them or overlook the issues! As far as I'm concerned, this is my last response to this repository, and I will never open, read, or install anything again..."
Terrible packaging.
"You guys are scammers, this is not even malware or jailbreak."
"Income. You guys, shithead."
Did you miss my comment? Or what?
I have removed TRIFA from my device.
"A very troubling issue: TRIFA does not restore any Tox IDs created on other devices at all! I need to import the Tox ID I've already created into qTox, but I can't do it at all!"
"The developers of TRIFA are not listening to the users' voices and complaints, they are ignoring the problems or turning a blind eye! If you'll allow me to say so, this is the last reply I will make to this repository, and I will never open, read, or install anything from here again."

"""We want to improve people's experiences. How ridiculous..."""
Are you limiting free speech?
"We would like to make it clear that our policy is not to lock threads where differing opinions exist. Respectful debate is healthy and important. However, if respect is disregarded and people are insulted, and the code of conduct is ignored, the discussion becomes unproductive. Such destructive acts are not tolerated in our community."
The issue is the use of the OS that your team is forcing on us. Using it the way you want us to is a million times harder than what would be convenient for us.

"I submit the issue, the maintainer closes it, reopens it, and closes it again - all while ignoring the essence of the problem."
"We must report that your choice of words and tone are in violation of our explicit code of conduct. In specific, the above comment (including any other interactions you have had until now) is unwelcome in this community, insulting, and entirely inappropriate. This is an official warning to adhere to our code of conduct. Any further violation will result in escalated actions. This might include banishment from this project."
"Beyond banning me, what will you do? I won't change my words, tone, or style. Words and tones are perfectly reasonable considering the situation. I will continue to be myself and repel this attack on my personality."
This software has low ratings and is not useful. What's more serious is that there is no clear manual on how to create the application.
"It always crashes, refuses to accept any settings created by the user, and discards the user's settings to use its own poor ones."
"The world's worst program, and I will send spam in any place I like."
"I have blocked this user, it's a hopeless case. Whatever his talents are, they are neither technical nor social, it's unbelievable."
It's really unpleasant that the app is still locked in portrait mode even in the year 2020.

Has this fixed the noisy PulseAudio issue?
"It might sound noisy and negative, but I apologize. Pyflakes is a wonderful thing, and I understand how difficult it is to express gratitude for maintaining such an OS library. I appreciate all of your efforts."
Seeing such behavior in such an important project is extremely disappointing. You and the other maintainers should seriously consider adding a code of conduct to this repository and adhere to it.
"Censor the comments, misuse labels such as ""spam"" or ""off-topic"" inappropriately, and generally behave rudely. @samuelcolvin made a special leisurely trip to show appreciation for your work."
"Just because you think in a certain way, it doesn't mean that others will think in a different way, there are no absolutes in ethical issues. It's hard to believe that there would be anyone who would run this Ansible Playbook without checking what is being done, as everything in this repository is 100% open source."
The internal viewer is a bull.
There are tens of millions of apps far better than that irresponsible internal app.
"In this completely dysfunctional damn project, priorities are completely misjudged, destroying the entire NextCloud ecosystem."

"Wow, you are completely correct. If everyone here could always generate reliable code like a genius, why wouldn't we abandon all checks and CI tools? Lesséa, I can't believe you're that foolish. It's truly surprising considering how much I praised your intelligence just yesterday. Maybe you weren't taught about safe programming at university..."

"I think it would be good if you could take this issue with a bit of skepticism at some point. The work of web components, like other standard tasks, requires us to have a diplomatic attitude and we should pave a positive path towards problem-solving. I understand the frustration caused by the lack of certain features, but there are several points in this thread that are not constructive. If your goal is to make the proposed features usable, a different approach will be much more useful in your case."
"As for the matter of being warned, I will return the favor. You are the one who should help here. Your opinion is as irrelevant as you not participating in the discussion."

"Where is Python2 used? Why does the command 'brew install python' install python3 instead of python2? Developers, are you all right? Why is it so difficult to separate them?"
I do not recommend interacting with EOL software.
"And, I recommend that you quit doing this! There are still many places that use Python2 and only some modules are installed in them, but you have removed it from the repository. Are you thinking with your head, or is your head a place for hamburgers?"
"This name is in use and should be changed immediately. Yes, I saw other problems. Yes, I will open a new one to express my displeasure towards Microsoft. You are just trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open source projects."

"Please imagine, attempting to disguise in between MS and Linux, then turning it into a competition about how big things can get, using the number of stars in the repository and other statistical data. You just don't want to admit your failure, right? Lol."
Beautiful! Say it's okay to steal the name! Good location!
"The tone and style of your remarks violate our code of conduct. The problematic comments have been marked as inappropriate, and you have been blocked for 7 days. If such behavior continues, we will have to block you permanently."
"Why are you changing the title? If this is a feature, it is meaningless."
"This is a topic that is not related to Jupyterlab, and it's an issue that is well-documented in various other repositories and on Stack Overflow, so I will close it. Google is a useful tool, and I will list here sample articles that I found by searching ""multiple conda environments jupyter"" on Google."
"That system is beyond boring. It gave a false impression that developers could guess actual usage based on how conspicuous the problem was, leaving bugs hidden for over 10 years. Trouble-free functions were mistaken as useless, and functions that frequently absorbed developers' attention were promoted to further monopolize their efforts. Obvious simple solutions that were rejected by tests requiring the existence of bugs are being swept under the rug, self-consciously avoiding fraudulent actions such as increasing complexity imposed on users and deprecation within minor versions."
"If you don't want to use C, I think you should first design and implement your own language. It's definitely not a C++ hell..."
"Please ensure 100% that you do not ruin the UI, especially in countries where people speak different languages like in Belgium. (Your colleagues made a huge mistake in the store.)"
PS. Don't you think it's about time? Don't you think this has been delayed for years?
"Those who get frustrated finding this issue, and those who are angry because the author has neglected to fix it for many years, please abandon mitmproxy and use SSL SPLIT."
I used SSL Split and it worked well compared to mitmproxy. Goodbye!
