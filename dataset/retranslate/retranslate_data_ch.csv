Go to hell.
The worst application. Please don't let it become the worst application in history. Thank you.
Merge my PR damn it.
"Amy, I need an explanation. What on earth is this, haha."
"I need to respond, answer me!"
What is this bullshit.
The Readme is useless.
"The real problem is this life, hoping to die sooner."
"Before the pop-ups saying ""Please follow me!!!"" and ""Register a ++ account!!!!"" disappear or can be closed, I refuse to use any ++ application. My gosh, it's really annoying."
I decided to say forget about him...
"Could you please rearrange it, reinsert the excellent switch statement again, you annoying fellow."
"This is a stupid request, it will damage the code more than your previous contributions."
"Your conducts of infecting other computers with malware are really unacceptable. Your project looks good on paper, but covertly installing malware on people's computers is just too despicable. What are you thinking? Do you think everyone is so foolish that they won't realize what's going on?"
You are all a bunch of criminals and cheats. Why do you include malware in the download package first?
"I believe you understand the meaning of the number, why you chose it, and why you did so. You tried to appear ""smart"" and ""funny"", as well as ""prank"", but this was very inappropriate and was immediately noticed. This is very heartbreaking, disrespectful, and extremely unethical: there are children in this chat room, this is a public chat room. The reason for your ban is: inappropriate behavior, bypassing filters, posting explicit content, violating the Wheaton's Law (inducing two other users to blindly re-enter)."
"This is exactly why you are banned: you have shown no respect for the chat rules or other users, and obviously, you have no respect or dignity for yourself, to the extent that you behave so rudely in this issue tracker. You can't behave properly, and can't be trusted to act appropriately in front of minors/public. Absolutely shocking and disgraceful behavior."
Get lost.
My account has been booked because I just registered using your damn tool.
"Hello, we apologize for any inconvenience caused by using our tool, but we do not bear any responsibility for the use of our tool!"
This is dog shit.
"""Mental retardation."""
"It may need to be mentioned in the measurement document, because I was stuck on this issue for a long time and almost wanted to give up using the measurement tool."
"In order to truly solve this problem, I'd like to remind everyone to adhere to our code of conduct. Especially the part about showing empathy. Here are two options: help us to solve the problem, which could be through providing constructive comments or submitting pull requests. Alternatively, choose another tool that better suits your project requirements. However, please understand that the contributors are doing their best."
It seems I've been acting like an idiot. I'm sorry.
What on earth are you talking about? The review of SoC applications has applied the judge's judgment debuff effect.
"Yes, you're right, I was really too foolish about this matter. I'm sorry."
"There's no peer or network confirmation that it's closed. However, the exchange's tokens are skyrocketing, what's going on?!"
Whether the database has recently performed a VACUUM operation does not affect the integrity of the data or SQL queries - what you suggest is complete nonsense.
"""If you absolute idiots continue to harass me with those 'me too' questions, expect to be banned."""
"The color is really bad for the log aggregator, look at this pile of shit:."
Each new version is worse.

I have already deleted TRIFA from my device.
"Very annoying problem: TRIFA never restores backups of Tox IDs created on other devices! I need to import the Tox ID I have already created into my qTox, but I just can't do it!"
"The developers of TRIFA do not listen to users and their complaints, they just ignore them or look at their problems! From my side, this will be my last reply in this repository, I will never open, read, or install anything from it."
Terrible package.
"You are all liars, this isn't even malware or jailbreak."
Income. Go to yours.
Did you miss my comment or what?
I have already deleted TRIFA from my device.
"Very annoying problem: TRIFA never recovers backups of Tox IDs created on other devices! I need to import the Tox ID I have already created into my qTox, but I can't do it at all!"
"The developers of TRIFA don't listen to the complaints of the users, they just ignore them or their problems! Personally speaking, this is my last response on this codebase, I will never open, read or install anything from it ever again."
The worst quality product is made with JavaScript. Please don't ruin GTK like this!
"About my background (which is helpful for understanding my viewpoint), I have been a dominator in the BDSM world for the past twenty years. What do we value most? That is consent."
"Do you think it's important when a jerk who abuses others messes with their minds? Terms like ""psychological manipulation"" are popular, but the correct one should be psychological manipulation."
"What I mean is, hypothetically speaking, we are discussing here the enticement of underage girls if we need some exaggerated statements. This may not be..."
"That's right. You still haven't explained why there are ""hide"" and ""delete"" two functions here."
"Just accept the fact, there are too many junk in your context menu that need cleaning up. If you remove ""delete"" and ""information"", no one would care."
Just like you can really mess with yourself.
"If you're not going to accommodate non-native apps, you should at least provide apps that align with your philosophy - but you just don't. You are just arrogant, unreasonable jerks."
"Don't give such foolish advice, it's even less effective than using a mouse to click a dedicated button."
"""We want to improve people's experiences."" What nonsense."
Cutting down freedom of speech?
"I want to make it clear that our policy is not to lock discussion threads when there are disagreements. Respectful debate is healthy and important. However, when you start personal attacks, show disrespect and ignore norms of behavior, the discussion becomes meaningless. Our community does not tolerate such destructive behavior."
"The issue lies in your team forcing us to use the operating system in your way, even though this makes using it in your way a million times harder than the way we find convenient."
BSV is garbage.
Why use BSV... Use BTC.
"I raised a question, but the maintainer closed, reopened, and closed it again - ignoring the substance of the question."
"I need to inform you that we have found your language and tone to be in violation of the behavioral guidelines we have explicitly set forth. Specifically, in every interaction you've had so far (including the aforementioned comments), disrespectful, insulting behavior, and inappropriate displays in this community have been involved. This is a formal warning to abide by our behavioral guidelines, any further violations will lead us to take more severe measures, including but not limited to banning your participation in this project."
"What other measures will you take besides banning me? I will neither change my language, nor my tone or style. In this situation, both language and tone are completely reasonable. I will always stay true to myself, and I will resist any attacks on my personality."
"The reviews for this software are poor, it's completely useless. There's not even a clear instruction manual on how to make an application, which makes the problem even worse."
"It always crashes, refuses to accept any user-customized settings, discards the user's settings, and uses its own terrible settings."
"The worst program in the world, I want to send spam wherever I want to send it."
"I've already blocked this user, a truly hopeless case. No matter what skills they may have, they definitely are not in neither technical nor social aspects. It's unbelievable."
Seeing applications locked in portrait mode in 2020 is really ugly.
"How can this be a priority? The application must be ready for shipment within a few days, and basically, no one uses the landscape mode of smartphones other than for watching media."
"Moreover, some disabled people can't rotate their phones and prefer to use landscape mode."
"""Don't tell me what to do, and I won't tell you where to go"" (proverb). I use tools, regardless of fashion trends or nonsense on the market."
Yes: this means you will not receive any help from me regarding that issue. I will not encourage the use of XP.
Does this solve the problem of the annoying pulse audio?
"I'm sorry if I may sound a bit nagging and negative, but pyflakes is really useful. I understand that maintaining an operating system library like this may be thankless. Thank you all for your hard work."
Seeing such behavior occur in such an important project is really disappointing. You and other maintainers should strongly consider adding a code of conduct to this repository and adhere to it.
"Reviewing comments, wrongly marking content as ""spam"" and ""off-topic"", and overall rude behavior. @samuelcolvin even specifically thanked you for your work."
"Just because you think in a certain way does not mean that others will think in another way. When it comes to moral issues, there is no absolute standard. Everything in this repository is 100% open source, so I find it hard to believe that someone would run this Ansible playbook without studying its function."
The internal observer is nonsense.
There are millions of applications that are much better than this kind of poor internal nonsense.
"In this completely malfunctioning garbage project, all priorities have been completely misplaced, totally destroying the entire NextCloud ecosystem."
The software is just trash. That's it.
"Once again. No discussion allowed. No criticism allowed. Just stick your fingers in your ears and sing. To avoid hearing about the impending disaster, to avoid hearing the truth about the quality of this project. Goodbye."
"Abstinence is the best way to avoid internet dangers! If you can't resist temptation, at least use a protective measure before connecting to the internet."
"I understand you are trying to help... but it seems like your efforts are not that great. Clearly, most of the items on this list are nonsense."
"Wow, you're absolutely correct. If everyone here is a genius, able to write reliable code 100% of the time, then why not just throw away all the checks and CI tools? Lessaire, you can't be that stupid. It's shocking, just yesterday I was talking about how smart you are. I guess you weren't taught about safe programming in college..."
"What is the repetition? Go fix those damn errors, this isn't even a repetition, this is a new damn thread, you idiot."
"Our jumpsuit looks like shit. (I know this is no longer used for the assistant, but it still looks like garbage.)"
"As a software engineer, I am shocked by the quality of this code and its role in public policy. The deficiencies in testing and quality assurance need to be clarified immediately to ensure that the statements made by its data are valid."
"He is the cancer of open source, it's only a matter of time before Microsoft strikes at this issue."
"Of course there is, you just need to solve one of the last 30 identical problems. #745 hasn't even been solved yet, and it's already 2018. Hello."
"I hope you can hold a skeptical attitude towards this at some point. For network components to work, just like any other standard job, we need to exercise some diplomacy and try to find a positive way to solve the problems we want to solve. Although I may understand the frustration brought by the lack of features, some views on this topic are not constructive. If your goal is to make the suggested features available, then adopting a different approach will be more beneficial to your case."
"So about being warned, I respond to you with the same courtesy. You are the person who should be providing help here. Your viewpoint is as irrelevant as you are if there isn't argument to support it."
You are really embarrassing.
"Again, this post has violated the code of conduct. Please do not make such comments again, this is unacceptable. Now you have been warned twice."
"Save it, you're just overly proud, it's simply pathetic now."
"In this stubborn and unreasonable situation, I can only choose to use another technique. You should be w3c, not a self-righteous stubborn uncle who thinks he knows better than everyone else."
"Perhaps you should really write those things down. You know, like in a document. Especially in the Multmatrix section of the document, it specifically points out that this program cannot manage all matrix operations. It's hilarious, this is simply half-baked."
Do not cooperate with Facebook and Google.
"Learn to communicate respectfully and then come back. In fact, don't bother."
"In fact, the document you wrote is simply terrible. I am a real man, and this is how I feel about your rotten document."
Please do not use Hydra.
"When I tried to create a cluster, CouchDB drained my vitality and tried to make me commit suicide."
Widevine is garbage.
"I will simply say: it is because of people like you that this device has been withdrawn. It's you - the one creating problems @microsoftceo2, very bad - it's not the fault of Widevine or the player, nor is it hidden due to your illegal use of decryption keys."
"If you don't like it, then fork it. Stop the harassment about it, we will never completely remove the insult filter."
"Isn't this clear enough? Insulting remarks violate our code of conduct and the goals of this project. If you want to use racial or gender insults, you can go to voat or gab; we don't allow it here."
"Have you gone mad? How did you manage to create such a difficult-to-use software filled with junk programs? Simplicity is possible, what on earth are you doing?"
"The Chinese translation of these sentences is: What's wrong with Retroarch? Everything is a problem! It's just terrible, it's a mess!."
"Your project has been in existence for 10 years, yet it still doesn't have a directly usable interface, not even a guide to explain how to normalize it, explain what you need to recover images, and so on."
"I don't know what could cause this problem to occur again because I have no idea where the problem lies. I just tried for the third time to reinstall your flawed, utterly awful software."
"According to our code of conduct, because we do not accept such behavior here, we have closed and locked it."
I want to install my program on my second hard drive.
"He obtained the code at the beginning of 2017, not 7 years ago. Don't be a jerk, because the source code was stolen at that time and then implemented on this."
"Please comply with our code of conduct, remain civil and courteous, do not use vulgar language, otherwise I will ban you from participating in all Falcon projects. This is your final warning."
"I am not a robot, but if you want to ignore me, go ahead, I will go find a lawyer."
I can't even install this damn application.
"Where can I find Python2? Why, when I input the command 'brew install python', is Python3 installed instead of Python2? Developers, are you guys spacing out over there? Why is differentiating between the two so difficult?"
I suggest not to interact with the EOL software.
"I suggest you stop! Many places are still using Python2, and only some modules are installed under it, yet you have removed it from the library. Are you actually using your brain to think or is your head filled with hamburgers?"
"This name is currently in use and should be changed immediately. Yes, I have already seen the other problems. Yes, I am starting a new one because of my dissatisfaction with Microsoft. You are just trying to cast a shadow on other genuine open source projects."
"Your comment's tone and style have violated our code of conduct. We have flagged the problematic comment as abuse and have blocked you for 7 days. If such behavior continues, we will permanently block you."
"You can be as angry as you want, but we need to be realistic... The approval you get for this project you're so passionately fighting for, is less than the objections I get for telling you that your behavior is absurd."
"Imagine trying to maintain a facade with ms... linux, then turning things into a crappy competition about repo star ratings and other statistical data because you messed up and don't want to admit it. It's hilarious."
Beautiful! You steal the name and say it's okay! Good location!
"The tone and style of your comment violated our code of conduct. We have marked the problematic comment as abuse and temporarily blocked you for 7 days. If this behavior persists, we will permanently block you."
"Why change the title? If this is a feature, then it is useless."
"This is unrelated to JupyterLab and is well documented in various other code libraries and Stack Overflow, so this issue is closed. Google is a good tool, here is an example article I found by googling ""multiple conda environments jupyter""."
"This system is downright frustrating. It allowed an error to hide for over a decade, giving people a misconception that developers can infer actual usage based on problem prominence. Fault-free functions are mistakenly assumed to be useless, while those that frequently attract developer attention are promoted, further monopolizing their efforts. A simple and visible solution is rejected by tests insisting on the existence of flaws, and is about to be swept under the rug, in favor of increasing complexity for users and bad practices in minor versions, such as deprecation."
"I think if you don't want to use C, then you should first design and implement your own language. Not the nightmare that is C++."
"Please make sure you don't mess up the user interface; in countries like Belgium, people speak different languages (your colleague has already made a huge mistake handling the store)."
"PS. Damn it, don't you think this has already been delayed for many years?"
"Whoever discovered this issue and is annoyed because the author hasn't fixed it for years, please stop using mitmproxy and switch to SSL SPLIT."
"I used SSL Split, it works very well compared to mitmproxy. Goodbye!"
It looks like you just read the title and left it there without doing any review. I hate to have you in charge of any security issues.
No need for a silly format to understand that! Thank you.
Too busy to reply?
Just be yourself.
"We rarely need to implement these guiding principles and take action. The consistent basic principle is not to be a jerk, then you'll be fine :)."
