Fuck that
Worst. App. Ever. Please don't make it the worst app ever. Thank you.
Merge my PR damn it again..
"Amy, I need an explanation. What the hell is this lol.."
"I NEED an ANSWER, ANSWER ME!"
What kind of shit is this..
Readme is useless.
"The actual problem is this life, want to die soon."
"I refuse to use all ++ applications until the ""PLS FOLLOW ME!!!"" and ""SIGN UP FOR A ++ ACCOUNT!!!!"" popups disappear or can be disabled. My God, it's annoying..."
"I have decided to say ""screw it""...."
"Could you possibly please get your shit together and reintegrate the brilliant Switch-statement, bitch..."
This is a stupid request that would ruin the code even more than your previous contribution.
"Not very nice of you assholes to infect other computers with malware. Your project looks good on paper, but secretly trying to install malware on people's computers is mean. What were you thinking? That everyone is dumb enough not to notice?"
You are a gang of criminal crooks. Why would you even insert malware into download packages?
"I’m pretty sure you know what this number means, why you chose it, and why you did what you did. Your attempt to be 'smart' and 'funny' while you 'troll' was incredibly distasteful and immediately noticeable. It was sad, disrespectful, and immoral: there are children in this chat room, it is a public chat room. You are banned for: Inappropriate behavior, Evading the filter, Explicit content, Wheaton's Law (enticing 2 other users to blindly repeat).."
"For this exact reason you were blocked: you showed no respect for the rules or the other users in the chat, you obviously have little respect or dignity for yourself to behave so unrestrained in this problem tracker, you can't behave and you can't be trusted to behave appropriately in front of minors/the general public. Absolutely outrageous and disgraceful behavior."
GET LOST..
My account is registered because I just signed up with your damn tool.
"Hello, we apologize for the inconvenience caused by the use of your tools. We take no responsibility for the use of our tools!"
That is shit.
"You haven't provided any sentences, only the German word ""Verzögerung"" which translates to ""delay"" in English."
"Probably this should be mentioned in the Gauge document, since I was stuck on this problem for quite a long time and almost wanted to give up using Gauge."
"In the interest of actually solving this problem, I would like to point to our code of conduct. Particularly in regards to showing empathy. Here, there are two options: Help us solve the problem, either with constructive comments or by sending a pull request. Choose another tool that better meets the requirements of your project. But please understand, contributors are doing their best."
It seems like I behaved like an idiot. I'm sorry.
"What the hell are you talking about? When judging SoC, the debuff Crusader's Judgement is applied..."
"Yes, you are right, I totally overreacted in this matter. Apologies..."
"No peers and network confirmation missing... But token pump on the exchange, WTF?!.."
Whether the database was recently VACUUM'd has no impact on the integrity of the data or SQL queries - what you are suggesting is complete nonsense.
"Expect a ban if you continue to spam me with ""me too"" from the issue, you absolute idiots."
"""Colors are terrible for log aggregators, just look at this mess:"""
Each new version is worse.
"Unfortunately, as an AI, I can't directly translate files. But I'm more than happy to translate the content text if it's provided here. If you're referring to the 'Enforcement of CoC' section of a general code of conduct, here's a potential translation:

I have removed TRIFA from my device.
"Very annoying issue: TRIFA never restores backups of Tox IDs that were created on other devices! I need to import my already created Tox ID on my qTox, but I can't do this at all!.."
"The developer of TRIFA does not listen to the users and their complaints, he simply ignores them or does not look at their problems! From my side, this is the last response from me in this repository and I will never open, read or install anything from it again..."
Crappy package.
"You are fraudsters, this is not even malware or a jailbreak."
"Turnover. Fuck you, people..."
Did you overlook my comment or what?
I have removed TRIFA from my device.
"Very annoying problem: TRIFA never restores the backup of Tox ID that was created on other devices! I have to import my already created Tox ID on my qTox, but I can't do it at all!"
"The developer of TRIFA does not listen to the users and their complaints, he just ignores them or does not see their problems! From my side, this is the last response from me in this repository & I will never again open, read, or install anything from it."
The worst quality products are made with JavaScript. Please don't ruin the GTK like this!
"Regarding my background (which is relevant to understanding my standpoint), I have been a Dominant in the BDSM world for almost twenty years. Something that is very important to us? Consent.."
"Do you believe that it counts when an abusive jerk plays mind games with someone? Terms like 'Gaslighting' are popular, but the correct one is psychological manipulation."
"I mean, hypothetically speaking, we are talking here about seducing underage girls, if we want to exaggerate. Which might not be the case..."
No shit. You still haven't explained why there is Hide AND Remove.
"Just accept the truth, you have so much junk in the context menu and it needs to be cleaned up. If you would get rid of 'Remove' and 'Info', no one would bat an eye."
So you can literally fuck yourself.
"If you don't support apps for non-natives, you should at least really offer apps that match your ideas, BUT YOU DAMN WELL DON'T. Talking about arrogant assholes..."
Don't make such stupid suggestions that don't work any better than clicking on a specific button with the mouse.
"""We would like to improve people's experience."" What nonsense.."
Restrict freedom of speech?
"I really want to make it clear that it is not our policy to lock threads in which different opinions are represented. Respectful debates are healthy and important. But if you start calling names, being disrespectful, and disregarding the code of conduct, the discussion becomes unproductive. This kind of destructive behavior is not tolerated in our community."
"The problem lies in the fact that your team is forcing us to use the operating system in the way you want, even though it is a million times more difficult to use it your way than what would be convenient for us."
BSV is garbage.
Why use BSV... Use BTC..
"I report a problem, the administrators close it, reopen it, close it again - while they ignore the essence of the problem."
"I must inform you that we have determined that your language and tone violate our expressly stated code of conduct. In particular, the above comment (along with other interactions you have made so far) is unwelcome, offensive and overall inappropriate for this community. This is an official warning to adhere to our code of conduct, and further violations will lead to escalating measures, including but not limited to, a ban from this project."
"What else will you do beside banning me from the house? I will neither change my language, nor my tone or style. Both, language and tone, are completely appropriate under the given circumstances. I will remain myself and defend this attack on my individuality."
"This software is not well-rated and useless. There is no clear instruction on how to create the application, which is even more serious."
"It always crashes, it refuses to accept user-specific settings and discards user settings, using its own bad settings."
World's worst program and I will spam wherever the hell I want.
"I have blocked this user, hopeless case, whatever their talent is, it is neither technical nor social, unbelievable..."
It is really ugly to see an app locked in portrait mode in the year 2020.
"How would that be a priority, the app needs to be ready for dispatch in a few days and essentially no one uses the smartphone in landscape mode, except for viewing media."
So there are people with disabilities who can't turn their mobile phone and prefer to use the landscape mode.
"""Don't tell me what to do and I won't tell you where to go"" (Proverb) I use tools regardless of fashion trends or marketing nonsense."
And yes: This means that you will not receive any help from me regarding this problem. I will not promote the use of XP.
Has that fixed the annoying Pulse-Audio nonsense?
"I'm sorry to complain and sound negative, pyflakes is great and I know how thankless maintaining OS libraries like this can be. Many thanks to everyone for your hard work."
It is very disappointing to see this behavior in such an important project. You and the other administrators should seriously consider adding a code of conduct to this repo and adhering to it.
"Censoring comments, calling things ""Spam"" and ""off topic"" when they are not, and generally being rude. @samuelcolvin even made a special effort to thank you for your work."
"Just because you have ONE way of THINKING does not mean that others think DIFFERENTLY, there are no absolutes in ethical concerns. Everything in this repo is 100% open source, so I really find it hard to believe that someone would run this Ansible playbook without investigating what it does."
Internal observers are crap.
There are countless much better apps than this inferior internal nonsense.
"Completely misguided priorities in this completely dysfunctional piece of shit project, which is destroying the entire NextCloud ecosystem."
The software is shit. Period.
"Again. No discussion allowed. No criticism allowed. Just stick your fingers in your ears and sing. In order not to hear of the impending disaster, to not hear the truth about the quality of this project. Goodbye."
"Abstinence is the best way to protect yourself from dangers on the Internet! If you can't resist the urge, at least put a condom on your network cable before you plug it in!."
I understand that you are trying to be helpful ... but you are not trying very hard. It is obvious that most of this list is nonsense.
"Wow, you're absolutely right. Why on earth not just drop all the checks and CI tools when everyone here is a genius producing reliable code 100% of the time? Come on Lessaire, you can't be this stupid. It's shocking considering that just yesterday I was talking about how intelligent you are. I guess you weren't taught anything about secure programming at university..."
"Which duplicates? Fix the damn errors, it is not even duplicated, it's a new damn thread, you stupid idiot."
"Our overalls look shitty. (I know that this one is no longer used for assistants, but it still looks like garbage.)."
"As a software engineer, I am appalled by the quality of this code and the role it has played in public policy. The deficits in testing and quality assurance need to be addressed immediately to ensure the claims made by its data."
He is a cancer for open source and it's only a matter of time before Microsoft takes action against this thing.
"Of course it exists, you just had to solve one of the last 30 identical problems. #745 isn't even solved yet and we're in 2018. Hello there...."
"I hope you take this with a pinch of salt. For working with web components, as with any other standard work, we need to exercise a certain degree of diplomacy and try to find a positive way to solve something that we wish to solve. Although I may understand the frustration about the lack of a feature, there are some points in this thread that are simply not constructive. Another approach would be much more helpful for your case, if your goal is to have the suggested feature available."
"Also in regards to the warning, I return the compliment to you. You are the one who is supposed to help here, your opinion is as irrelevant as you without arguments."
You are a disgrace.
"Again, this post violates the code of conduct. Please refrain from making such comments. This is not acceptable. You have now been warned twice."
"Preserve it, you were just too proud and now it's just ridiculous."
"At this point of persistent nonsense, I will simply use a different technology. You should be the W3C, not our stubborn uncle who thinks he knows better than everyone else."
"Maybe you should actually write that down somewhere. You know, for instance in the documentation. Especially in the Multmatrix section of the documentation, to make it clear that this program is not capable of handling all matrix operations. LOL, it's half finished.."
Do not work with FB and Google.
"Learn to communicate with respect and come back. Actually, don't bother.."
"Actually, you're writing a crappy document. I am a real man, that's my feeling from your holy crappy document."
Please do not use Hydra.
"When I try to create a cluster, CouchDB drains my life energy and tries to push me to commit suicide."
Widevine is crap.
"I'll be brief: It's because of people like you that this device is being revoked. You - the person causing this problem @microsoftceo2 is crap by the way - not Widevine or the player, let alone the fact hiding that you are illegally using decryption keys."
"If you don't like it, make a fork of it. Stop bothering us with it, we will never completely remove the swear word filter."
Isn't that clear enough? Insults violate our code of conduct and the objectives of this project. Go to Voat or Gab if you want to use racist or sexist insults; we do not allow them here.
"Are you crazy? How could you create such a useless, overloaded software? It could be simple, what the hell are you doing?"
"What is wrong with Retroarch? Everything is wrong! It is terrible, absolute garbage basically!"
"Your project has been running for about 10 years and there is still no usable interface directly out of the box, not even a guide that explains how to make this poor software normal, tell me what you need to restore the graphics etc."
"I don't know what will reproduce the problem because I don't know what the problem is. I just tried to reinstall your faulty, shitty software for the third time."
"Close and lock, as we do not allow this behavior here according to our code of conduct:"
I want my stuff to be installed on my secondary hard drive.
"He took the code at the beginning of 2017, not 7 years ago. Don't be an idiot, the source code was stolen and implemented at that time."
"Please behave in a civilized manner and refrain from obscenities as our code of conduct requires, otherwise, I will exclude you from all falconry projects. This is the final warning."
"I am not a bot, but if you want to ignore me, go ahead and I will get a lawyer."
Can't even install the damn app..
"Where the hell is Python2? Why is Python3 installed and not Python2 when I give the command brew install python? Developers, are you high there? Why is the separation so difficult?"
I recommend not dealing with EOL software.
"And I recommend you to stop! There are many other places where Python2 is used and only a few modules are installed underneath it, and you have deleted it from the repository. Do you even think with your brain, or do you have a hamburger instead of a head?"
"This name is being used and should be changed immediately. Yes, I have seen the other issues. Yes, I'm opening a new one because screw you Microsoft. They are only trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open-source projects."
"Your tone and manner of commenting violate our code of conduct. We have marked the problematic comments as abusive and blocked you for 7 days. If this behavior continues, we will permanently ban you."
"You can be as angry as you want, but let's be realistic... this project you are so passionately fighting for doesn't have as many stars as the thumbs down I have, because I'm telling you, you're being ridiculous."
"Imagine, you're trying to build a facade with ms-linux, then you turn things into a dick-measuring contest with repo-stars and other statistics, because you know you made a mistake but you don't want to admit it, lmfao.."
Nice! You steal the name and say it's okay! Good position!
"Your tone and the way you comment violate our code of conduct. We have marked the problematic comments as abusive and have banned you for 7 days. If this behavior continues, we will ban you permanently."
"Why change the title? If it's a function, it's USELESS."
"Close, as this is not related to Jupyterlab and is a well-documented issue in various other repos and Stack Overflow. Google is a good tool, here is an example article I found by googling ""multiple conda environments jupyter""."
"The system is more than cumbersome. It has kept an error hidden for over a decade and creates the false impression that developers can deduce the actual use due to the conspicuousness of problems. Faultless functions are considered useless, while functions that frequently catch the attention of developers are promoted for further monopolization of their effort. A simple obvious solution that is rejected by a test that must have the error is on the verge of being swept under the carpet in favor of increased complexity imposed on users and bad practices such as write-offs within a smaller version."
"I think, if you don't want to use C, you should first design and implement your own language. Not C++ hell..."
"Make sure you 100% secure the user interface for countries where people speak different languages, like Belgium, don't mess it up (your colleagues really screwed it up in the store)."
"P.S. Damn it, don't you also think that this has been overdue for years?"
"Whoever always encounters this problem and is annoyed about it, because the author doesn't bother to fix it for years, should give up on mitmproxy and use SSL SPLIT instead."
"I used SSL Split and it worked well, compared to mitmproxy. Goodbye!.."
"It seems like you looked at the title and left it at that, you didn't conduct any check or something similar. I would hate it if you were responsible for any security issues."
Don't need an outdated format to understand that! Thanks....
Too busy to answer?
Do your thing....
"Rarely do we need to enforce these guidelines and take measures. The general guideline is, as always, to not cause trouble and then everything will be fine :)..."
