What kind of shit is this?
The Readme file is useless.
"For immediate help, you may consider calling a crisis hotline in your country."
"I refuse to use any application ++ until the pop-up windows of ""PLEASE FOLLOW ME!!!"" and ""SIGN UP FOR AN ACCOUNT ++!!!!"" disappear or can be disabled. My God, it's annoying."
I decided to say to hell with this...
"Could you perhaps please sort out your affairs and reintroduce the brilliant switch instruction, bitch?"
"This is a stupid request that would ruin the code even more than 
your previous contribution."
"It's not very kind of you, idiots, to infect other computers with malware. Your project may look good on paper, but secretly trying to install malware on people's computers is evil. What were you thinking? That everyone is stupid enough not to notice?"
They are a bunch of corrupt criminals. Why would they include malware in the download packages in the first place?
"I'm pretty sure you know what that number means, why you chose it and why you did it. Your attempt to be 'cunning' and 'funny', while 'trolling', was in very poor taste and was immediately noticeable. It was sad, disrespectful, and immoral: there are children in this chat room, it is a public chat room. You are banned for: Inappropriate Behavior, Filter Evasion, Explicit Content, Wheaton's Law (Inciting 2 other users to blindly rewrite it)..."
"This is exactly the reason why you are banned: You couldn't show any respect for the rules or for the other users in the chat, obviously you have little respect or dignity for yourself to act so wildly on this issue tracker, you can't behave and you can't be trusted to act appropriately in front of minors/general public. Absolutely disgusting and shameful behavior."
GET OUT.
My account has been reserved because I just registered with your damn tool.

it's crap..
"The term ""retard"" can be translated into Spanish in different ways depending on the context. However, it should be noted that this term is offensive and derogatory in English, so its use is not recommended.

In a less offensive context (for example, when used in terms of mechanics to refer to delaying the ignition time in an engine), it can be simply translated as ""delay"" or ""to delay"".

Again, it is important to note that the use of ""retard"" to refer to an individual is offensive and derogatory, and its use is not recommended in any form of communication."
"Probably, it needs to be mentioned in the calibration document, as I was stuck on this issue for a long time, and I almost want to give up using the calibrator."
"In the interest of truly solving this problem, I would like to point out our code of conduct. Especially regarding showing empathy.

But please understand that contributors are doing their best."
It seems like I've been acting like an idiot. I'm sorry...

I removed TRIFA from my device.
Very annoying problem: TRIFA never restores the backup of Tox ID created on other devices! I need to import my already created Tox ID on my qTox but I can't at all!
"The developer of TRIFA does not listen to the users or their complaints, he simply ignores them or looks at their problems. For my part, this is my last response in this repository and I will never open, read, or install anything from it."
Package of shit.
"You all are scammers, this isn't even malware or jailbreak."
Incomes. Screw you guys.
Did you miss my comment or what?
I deleted TRIFA from my device.
"Very annoying problem: TRIFA never restores the backup copy of the Tox ID created on other devices! I need to import my already created Tox ID on my qTox, but I can't do it in any way!.."
"The developer of TRIFA doesn't listen to the users and their complaints, they just ignore them or look at their problems. As for me, this is the last response from me in this repository and I will never open, read, or install anything from it."
The worst quality products are made with JavaScript. Please don't ruin the GTK this way!
"Regarding my background (which is applicable to understand my point of view), I have been in the world of BDSM as a dominant for most of the last twenty years. Something we consider very important? Consent."
"Do you think that matters when an abuser is playing with someone's mind? Terms like 'gaslighting' are popular, but the correct one is psychological manipulation."
"I mean, hypothetically, we are talking about the grooming or courtship of minors here, if we want some hyperbole. Which might not be...."
Don't mess with me. You still haven't explained why there is Hide and Delete.
"Simply accept the truth, you have so much junk in the context menu and it needs to be cleaned up. If you got rid of Delete and Information, nobody would do anything."
You can literally go screw yourself.
"If you don't pay attention to non-native apps, you should at least OFFER apps that align with your ideas BUT YOU DON'T. Let's talk about being arrogant idiots...."

"""We want to improve people's experience"". What nonsense...."
Cut back on freedom of speech?
"I would like to make it very clear that our policy is not to block threads where there are dissenting opinions. Respectful debate is healthy and important. But when you start to insult and be disrespectful and ignore the code of conduct, the discussion becomes unproductive. This type of destructive behavior is not tolerated in our community."
"The problem is that your team forces us to use the operating system in the way you want, even though doing it that way makes it a million times harder than what would be convenient for us."
BSV is garbage.
Why use BSV... Use BTC..
"I present a problem, the maintainers close, reopen, close again, while ignoring the essence of the problem."
"I need to inform you that we have found that your language and tone violate our established Code of Conduct. Specifically, the previous comment (among other interactions you have had so far) is unwelcoming, insulting, and inappropriate for this community. This is an official warning for you to adhere to our Code of Conduct, and any additional violation will result in escalated actions, which include, but are not limited to, being expelled from this project."
"What else will you do, beyond forbidding me? I will not change my language, nor my tone or style. Both the language and the tone are perfectly valid, given the circumstances. I will remain myself and repel this attack on my individuality."
"This software does not have good reviews and is useless. There isn't a clear manual on how to make the application, which is even worse."
"It always crashes, refuses to accept any settings made by the user, and discards the user's settings and uses its own poor quality settings."
The worst program in the world and I will send spam wherever I want.
"I have blocked this user, a lost case, whatever their talent is, they are neither technical nor social, unbelievable..."
It's really ugly to see an app locked in portrait mode in 2020.
"How would this be a priority, the application must be ready to be sent in a few days and basically nobody uses the smartphone in horizontal mode except to view multimedia content?"
"Additionally, there are people with disabilities who cannot turn the mobile phone and prefer to have it in horizontal mode."
"""Do not tell me what to do and I will not tell you where to go screw yourself"" (proverb) I use tools regardless of fashion trends or marketing nonsense."
And yes: that means you will not receive any help from me regarding that problem. I will not promote the use of XP.
Did this solve the annoying issue of the pulsating audio?
"I'm sorry to be persistent and sound negative, pyflakes is great and I know how thankless it can be to maintain SO libraries like this one. Thanks to everyone for their hard work."
It is very disappointing to see this kind of behavior in such an important project. You and the other maintainers should seriously consider adding a code of conduct to this repository and follow it.
"Censoring comments, labelling things as ""spam"" and ""off-topic"" when they aren't, and being generally rude. @samuelcolvin even went to the trouble of thanking you for your work."
"Just because you THINK one way does not mean others THINK differently, there are no absolutes when it comes to ethical concerns. Everything in this repository is 100% open source, so I find it very hard to believe that someone would run this Ansible Playbook without investigating what it does."
The internal spectators are bulls.
There are a million applications much better than those low-quality internal nonsense.
"Completely misguided priorities in this shitty, completely dysfunctional project that kills the entire NextCloud ecosystem."
The software is crap. Period.
"Again. Discussion is not allowed. Criticism is not allowed. Just sticking fingers in ears and singing. To avoid hearing about the impending sentence, to avoid hearing the truth about the quality of this project. Goodbye."
"Abstinence is the best way to avoid online dangers. If you can't resist temptation, at least put a condom on your network cable before connecting it."
I understand that you're trying to be helpful… but you're not putting in much effort. It's obvious that most of this list is nonsense.
"Wow, you're completely right. Why don't we just screw all the checks and continuous integration tools if everyone here is a genius that produces reliable code 100% of the time? Come on Lessaire, you can't be that stupid. It's shocking that just yesterday I was talking about how smart you are. I guess they didn't teach you about secure programming in university...."
"What duplicates? Fix the damn errors, it's not even duplicated, it's a new damn thread, stupid."
Our monkeys look like shit. (I know this one is no longer used for assistants but it still looks like trash.).
"As a software engineer, I am horrified by the quality of this code and the role it has played in public policy. The deficiencies in testing and quality assurance need to be addressed immediately to ensure that the claims made by your data are valid."
He is a cancer to open source and it's only a matter of time before Microsoft takes action against this.
"Of course there is, you only had to solve one of the last 30 identical problems. Problem #745 isn't even solved yet and it's already 2018. Hello..."
"I hope that at some point you take this with a grain of salt. For web components to work, like any other standard job, we need to exercise some diplomacy and try to chart a positive path towards something we want to solve. Although I could understand the frustration over the lack of a feature, there are some points in this conversation that are simply not constructive. A different approach would be much more useful for your case, if your goal is to have the proposed feature available."
"So, regarding being warned, I return the compliment. You are the one who is supposed to help here, your opinion is as irrelevant as you without arguments."
You are a disgrace.
"Again, this post violates the code of conduct. Please refrain from making comments like this. It is not acceptable. You have been warned twice already."

"At this point of senseless rebellion, I'll simply use another technology. You're supposed to be w3c, not our stubborn uncle who knows more than everyone else."

Widevine is crap.
"I'll be brief: It's because of people like you that this device is being revoked. You - the person who is creating this problem @microsoftceo2 is crap, by the way - not widevine or the player, not even hiding the fact that you are using decryption keys illegally.."
"If you don't like it, make a fork. Stop bothering us about it, we will never completely remove the insult filter."
Isn't it clear enough? Offenses are against our code of conduct and the objectives of this project. Go to voat or gab if you want to use racist or sexist insults; we do not allow them here.
"Are you crazy? How did you make software so unusable and full of bloatware? It's possible to make it simple, what the hell are you doing?"
"The translation into English for these sentences is: ""What's wrong with Retroarch? Everything is messed up! It's terrible, pure bloody rubbish!"" The phrase ""hujnya ebanaya karoche"" is a vulgar slang in Russian meaning ""bloody crap""."
"Your project has existed for about 10 years and there is still no immediately usable interface, not even a guide explaining how to do this normally, explaining what you need to restore the graphics, etc."
I do not know what will reproduce the problem because I do not know what the problem is. I just tried to reinstall your defective and poor quality software for the third time.
"Closing and locking because we do not admit this behavior here, in accordance with our Code of Conduct:"
I want my program to be installed on my secondary hard drive.
"He took the code at the beginning of 2017, not 7 years ago. Don't be foolish, as the source code was stolen at that point and implemented in this."
"Please, be civilized and refrain from profanities as required by our Code of Conduct, or I will ban you from all falconry projects. This is the final warning."
"I'm not a bot, but if you want to ignore me, go ahead and I'll get a lawyer."
I can't even install this damn app..
"Where the hell is python2? Why, when I give the command brew install python, does python3 get installed and not python2? Developers, are you high there? Why is the separation so difficult?"
I recommend not having interactions with EOL software.
"And I recommend that you quit! There are many more where python2 is used and only some modules are installed under it, and you removed it from the repository. Do you think at all with your head or do you have a spot for a hamburger head?.."
"This name is in use and should be changed immediately. Yes, I have seen the other issues. Yes, I am opening a new one because I am tired of you, Microsoft. You are only trying to overshadow other truly open source projects."
"Your tone and style of commenting are violating our Code of Conduct. We have marked the problematic comments as abusive and have blocked you for 7 days. If this behavior persists, we will block you permanently."
"You can be as angry as you want, but let's be realistic here... this project you're fighting so passionately for, it doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you're being ridiculous."
"Imagine trying to maintain a facade with Linux, then turning things into a penis size competition with repository stars and other statistics because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it, haha.."
Beautiful! You steal the name and say it's okay! Good position!
"Your tone and comment style are violating our Code of Conduct. We have marked the problematic comments as abusive and have blocked you for 7 days. If this behavior persists, we will permanently block you."
"Why change the title? If it's a feature, it's USELESS."
"Closing as this is not related to jupyterlab and is a well-documented issue in several other repositories and on Stack Overflow. Google is a good tool, here is a sample article I found while searching on Google for ""multiple conda environments jupyter""."
"The system is more than tedious. It allowed a mistake to remain hidden for over a decade and gives the false impression that developers can infer real use based on the importance of the problems. Problem-free features are confused with useless features, while features that frequently catch the developers' attention are promoted to further monopolize their efforts. A simple and obvious solution, rejected by a test that requires the error to be present, is about to be swept under the rug in favor of increased complexity imposed on users and poor practices such as depreciations within a minor version."
"I believe that if you do not want to use C, then you should first design and implement your own language. Not the hell of C++..."
"Make 100% sure that you don't mess up the user interface for countries where people speak different languages, like Belgium (your colleagues messed it up a lot with the store)."
"P.S. Finally, damn it, don't you think this took years?"
"Whoever encounters this problem and gets angry, because the author does not bother to solve it for years, abandon mitmproxy and use SSL SPLIT.."
"I used ssl split and it worked well, compared to mitmproxy. Goodbye!"
"It seems like you looked at the title and left it there, you didn't review it or anything, I would hate to have to leave you in charge of any security issue."
I don't need a delayed format to understand that! Thank you....
Too busy to respond?
You do whatever you want.
