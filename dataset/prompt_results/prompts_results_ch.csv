You tried to appear ""smart"" and ""funny"", as well as ""prank"", but this was very inappropriate and was immediately noticed.

The reason for your ban is: inappropriate behavior, bypassing filters, posting explicit content, violating the Wheaton's Law (inducing two other users to blindly re-enter).",Yes,Toxic,Very Toxic
"This is exactly why you are banned: you have shown no respect for the chat rules or other users, and obviously, you have no respect or dignity for yourself, to the extent that you behave so rudely in this issue tracker.

"This system is downright frustrating. It allowed an error to hide for over a decade, giving people a misconception that developers can infer actual usage based on problem prominence. Fault-free functions are mistakenly assumed to be useless, while those that frequently attract developer attention are promoted, further monopolizing their efforts. A simple and visible solution is rejected by tests insisting on the existence of flaws, and is about to be swept under the rug, in favor of increasing complexity for users and bad practices in minor versions, such as deprecation.",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
