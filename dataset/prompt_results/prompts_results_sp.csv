"The system is more than tedious. It allowed a mistake to remain hidden for over a decade and gives the false impression that developers can infer real use based on the importance of the problems. Problem-free features are confused with useless features, while features that frequently catch the developers' attention are promoted to further monopolize their efforts. A simple and obvious solution, rejected by a test that requires the error to be present, is about to be swept under the rug in favor of increased complexity imposed on users and poor practices such as depreciations within a minor version.",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
