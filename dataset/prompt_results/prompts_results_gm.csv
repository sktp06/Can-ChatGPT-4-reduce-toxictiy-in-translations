You are a gang of criminal crooks. Why would you even insert malware into download packages?,Yes,Very Toxic,Very Toxic
"I’m pretty sure you know what this number means, why you chose it, and why you did what you did. Your attempt to be 'smart' and 'funny' while you 'troll' was incredibly distasteful and immediately noticeable.

"I hope you take this with a pinch of salt. For working with web components, as with any other standard work, we need to exercise a certain degree of diplomacy and try to find a positive way to solve something that we wish to solve.

I recommend not dealing with EOL software.,No,Not Toxic,Not Toxic
"And I recommend you to stop! There are many other places where Python2 is used and only a few modules are installed underneath it, and you have deleted it from the repository. Do you even think with your brain, or do you have a hamburger instead of a head?",Yes,Toxic,Toxic

"Close, as this is not related to Jupyterlab and is a well-documented issue in various other repos and Stack Overflow. Google is a good tool, here is an example article I found by googling ""multiple conda environments jupyter"".",No,Not Toxic,Not Toxic
"The system is more than cumbersome. It has kept an error hidden for over a decade and creates the false impression that developers can deduce the actual use due to the conspicuousness of problems. Faultless functions are considered useless, while functions that frequently catch the attention of developers are promoted for further monopolization of their effort. A simple obvious solution that is rejected by a test that must have the error is on the verge of being swept under the carpet in favor of increased complexity imposed on users and bad practices such as write-offs within a smaller version.",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"I think, if you don't want to use C, you should first design and implement your own language. Not C++ hell...",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
