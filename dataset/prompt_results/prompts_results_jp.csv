"That system is beyond boring. It gave a false impression that developers could guess actual usage based on how conspicuous the problem was, leaving bugs hidden for over 10 years. Trouble-free functions were mistaken as useless, and functions that frequently absorbed developers' attention were promoted to further monopolize their efforts. Obvious simple solutions that were rejected by tests requiring the existence of bugs are being swept under the rug, self-consciously avoiding fraudulent actions such as increasing complexity imposed on users and deprecation within minor versions.",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
