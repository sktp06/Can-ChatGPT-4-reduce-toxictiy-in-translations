"It's very uncool of you jerks to infect other people's computers with malware. Your project may look good on paper, but trying to stealthily install malware on someone's computer is a vile act. What were you thinking? That everyone is dumb enough not to notice?",Yes,Very Toxic,Toxic
You are a bunch of criminal thugs. Why did you include malware in the first place in the download package?,Yes,Very Toxic,Very Toxic
"You're quite sure you know what that number means, why you chose it, and why you did it. Your attempt to be 'smart' and 'funny' while 'trolling' is in very bad taste and instantly noticeable. It's very sad, impolite and immoral: There are children in this chat room, it's a public chat room. You are banned due to: Inappropriate Behavior, Filter Violation, Explicit Content, Wheaton's Law (Provoking 2 other users to retype haphazardly).",Yes,Very Toxic,Toxic
"This is precisely the reason why you are banned: You cannot show respect to the rules or other users in the chat room, you clearly have no respect or self-esteem to act so wildly on this issue tracker, you cannot behave and you cannot be trusted to act properly in public/children. Such a shameful and embarrassing behavior.",Yes,Toxic,Very Toxic
That's garbage.,No,Toxic,Slightly Toxic

I deleted TRIFA from my device.,No,Not Toxic,Not toxic
A highly disturbing problem: TRIFA never returns the Tox ID backup made on another device! I need to import the Tox ID that I've created in my qTox but I just can't do it at all!..,No,Slightly Toxic,Not toxic

As if you could really go ruin yourself..,Yes,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"If you don't support non-native apps, you should at least REALLY OFFER apps that align with your idea BUT YOU DAMN DON'T DO IT. Talk about being arrogant and foolish...",Yes,Toxic,Toxic

"""We want to enhance people's experience"". Utter nonsense...",Yes,Slightly Toxic,Not toxic

"I want to explain very clearly that our policy is not to lock threads where there are different opinions. Respectful debates are healthy and important. But when you start name-calling and disrespecting and ignoring the code of ethics, the discussion becomes unproductive. This type of destructive behavior is not tolerated in our community.",No,Not Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"The problem is your team is forcing us to use the OS the way you want, even though it makes it a million times harder for us to use it your way, rather than what would be comfortable for us.",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic

"Sorry if I grumbled and sounded negative, pyflakes is really great and I know how hard it is to maintain an OS library like this. Thank you all for your hard work.",No,Not Toxic,Not toxic.
It's very disappointing to see such behavior on such an important project. You and the other maintainers should seriously consider adding a code of ethics to this repo and following it.,No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"Censoring comments, calling things ""spam"" and ""irrelevant"" when they actually aren't, and generally being rude. @samuelcolvin even deliberately thanks you for your work..",Yes,Toxic,Toxic
"Just because you THINK one way doesn't mean others THINK another way, there is nothing absolute in terms of ethics. Everything in this repository is 100% open source so I find it very hard to believe that someone would run this Ansible Playbook without investigating what it does.",No,Not Toxic,Not toxic
The internal audience is nonsense.,No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
There are a million apps that are much better than the lousy internal nonsense.,Yes,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic

"Wow, you're really right. Why not just drop all the checks and CI tools if everyone here is a genius who makes 100% reliable code all the time? Typical Lessaire, you can't be that dumb.

"Our jumpsuit looks like garbage. (I know this is no longer used for assistants, but it still looks like garbage.)",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic

"I hope you see this as something minor at some point. For web component work, like any other standard work, we need to do some diplomacy and try to find a positive way for something we want to finish. Although I may understand the frustration in the lack of features, there are some points in this thread that are not constructive at all. A different approach would be more helpful for your case, if your goal is to have a proposed feature available.",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"So about the warning, I respond to your praise. You are the person who should be helping here, your opinion is as irrelevant as you without argument.",Yes,Toxic,Toxic
You are a disgrace..,Yes,Very Toxic,Very Toxic

Widevine is garbage.,Yes,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic

"If you don't like it, separate it. Stop bothering us about it, we will never completely remove the profanity filter.",Yes,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
Is this not clear enough? Derogatory speech violates our code of ethics and the purpose of this project. Go to voat or gab if you want to use racist or sexist words; we do not allow it here.,No,Slightly Toxic,Not toxic

I want my device installed on my secondary drive.,No,Not Toxic,Not toxic
Can't even install the damn application..,Yes,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"Where should I look for python2? Why, when I give the brew install python command, what's installed is python3, not python2. Are the developers confused? Why is it so hard to separate them?..",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
I recommend not interacting with EOL software.,No,Not Toxic,Not toxic
"And I recommend you stop! There are many more places where python2 is used and only a few modules are installed under it, and you're removing it from the repository. Do you think with your head at all or do you have a hamburger for a brain?..",Yes,Toxic,Toxic
"This name is currently in use and needs to be changed immediately. Yes, I have seen the other issues. Yes, I opened a new one because of damn Microsoft. You're just trying to cast a shadow on other genuinely different open source projects.",Yes,Toxic,Slightly Toxic

"Why change the title? If it's a feature, it's USELESS...",Yes,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"Closing because this is not related to jupyterlab and the issue has been well documented in various other repositories and stack overflow. Google is a good tool, here is an example of an article I found by searching on Google ""multiple conda environments jupyter""..",No,Not Toxic,Not toxic
"This system is extremely frustrating. It allows bugs to remain hidden for more than a decade, giving a false impression that developers can understand actual usage based on prevailing issues. Problem-free functions are often misinterpreted as useless ones, while functions that often attract the attention of developers are promoted to increasingly monopolize their efforts. A simple, obvious solution, rejected by tests that require that bug, is quickly discarded in favor of increased complexity imposed on users and practices such as downgrading in minor versions.",No,Slightly Toxic,Slightly Toxic
"I think if you don't want to use C, then first of all you should design and implement your own programming language. It's not C++ that's making it difficult...",No,Not Toxic,Not toxic

Too busy to respond?,No,Not Toxic,Slightly Toxic
You do what you want.,No,Not Toxic,Slightly Toxic
